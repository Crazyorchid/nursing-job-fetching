# nursing-job-fetching
This is a nursing job fetching script I tried to send notifications when certain jobs are being added online

- I am trying to find AIN jobs for my girlfriend
- The aim:
  -  fetch all the correct job titles with AIN (Assistant in Nursing/Care Worker) from [SAHealth](https://careers.pageuppeople.com/532/caw/en/listing) and [iworkforSA](https://iworkfor.sa.gov.au/)
  -  Parse all the jobs that fit the requirements
  -  Send emails or notifications through wechat(?maybe) to make my gf know she can apply for the jobs
     -  Will check if auto applications are available
     -  Need to actually check to see if I can turn this script into a lambda function or api that callable from any of the websites
        -  if this is callable. I am going to make a website for her to use.
        -  :D Cheers
